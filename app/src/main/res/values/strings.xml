    <string name="introduction">PharaSnap can help you copy text on the screen even on places where you don\'t have the facility directly copy text to clipboard. PharaSnap can even capture text on images without ever leaving the app</string>
    <string name="add_tile_description">To make this tool easily accessible to use it is recommended to add the quick settings shortcut in your notification panel. Open your notification panel, in the top section (quick settings panel) then tap to customize the panel and add the shortcut tile provided by this app to the active area. Drag and place it on a convenient place
        \n\nAnother way to open the widget is by hold pressing the app launch icon which prompt you open the widget.

    <string name="add_tile_requirement">Quick launching from quick settings in notification tiles is the most recommended way to launch/open this tool because it is very quicker and you don\'t switch between apps, simply slide down the notification tile panel and tap the shortcut button</string>
    <string name="media_projection_request_explanation">Whenever PharaSnap wants to read visual content of the screen (using picture mode or text recognition on pictures on the screen) you will be prompt for requesting screen capturing session to capture visual content on the screen (this is an system requirement for your Android Version).
    When the widget is collapsed or when switching away from picture mode which starts an idle cooldown to end screen capturing if not used. Then you will be prompted again to grant screen capturing if it is required again</string>
    <string name="capturing_modes_tutorial">PharaSnap has two modes text and picture mode. Text mode capture text on the screen upon tapping including text placed on images and added to your clipboard. You can capture text on any language on text elements on the screen but however when capturing text placed inside pictures PharaSnap will use text recognition which for now only support latin characters (including English).
On Picture Mode, you can capture screenshot of only the relevant picture from screen by tapping on it picture by automatically cropping out highlighted image - technically you can use this mode on other UI elements like text blocks, button .etc, not only pictures.
You can switch between the two modes with left-most button on the widget</string>
    <string name="text_copy_tutorial">Once you tap on the text on screen (not drag and select) it would get highlighted and you can select multiple selections at once.
        By default all text from all selected text blocks will be automatically copied to clipboard once you exit or collapse the floating widget. Also you can use text selection editor to only select the required text from the text blocks when you tap on the yellow bar.</string>
    <string name="recent_items_tutorial">You can also view your last copied items in the recent list from the floating widget itself. On hold pressing a single english word which prompts you the definition on Google web browser Give it a try!.</string>

So if encountered a similar situation please make sure the host app in in latest version.\nIf none works restart the accessibility service by toggling on and off in accessibility settings</string>
    <string name="first_troubleshooting_description">Some app can request some confidential/private pages on the app like igcognito tabs on chrome to be secured and blocks capturing visual contents on the screen which prevents image to text recognition to work. Please make sure content is not placed on secured screen for example like in chrome open the link from igconito tab to normal tab</string>
